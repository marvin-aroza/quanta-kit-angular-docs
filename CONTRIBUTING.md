## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or 20 â€” align with package.json "engines" or Angular docs)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository directly to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marvin-aroza/quanta-kit-angular-docs.git
cd quanta-kit-angular-docs
```

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Environment Configuration**

Currently, this project doesn't require specific environment variables. If any are needed in the future, they will be documented here.

3. **Running the Development Server**

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Angular development server at `http://localhost:4200`. The application will automatically reload when you make changes to the source files.

4. **Running Tests**

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in CI mode (for continuous integration)
npm run test:ci
```

5. **Building the Project**

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Build and watch for changes
npm run watch
```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style and Best Practices

#### Angular Conventions
- Follow the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper component lifecycle management
- Use reactive programming patterns with RxJS

#### Documentation-Specific Guidelines
- Ensure all component examples are working and up-to-date
- Include comprehensive code examples with clear explanations
- Use consistent styling and formatting across all documentation pages
- Test all interactive demos and examples thoroughly
- Maintain responsive design principles for all documentation content

#### Code Formatting
- We recommend using Prettier for code formatting; configuration is included in `package.json`.
- If you install Prettier and configure Husky + lint-staged, commits can be auto-formatted. (This repository currently has Husky hooks but no hook that runs Prettier.)

#### Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all new components and services
- Test all documentation examples and interactive demos
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use Angular Testing Utilities and Jasmine/Karma
- Test files should be named `*.spec.ts`

#### Documentation Standards
- Document all public APIs using JSDoc comments
- Update README.md if you add new features or sections
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Ensure all code examples are functional and tested
- Update this CONTRIBUTING.md if you change the development process

### Branch Naming Convention

Create branches using the following format:

```
<type>/<ticket-number>-<brief-description>
```

**Examples:**
- `feat/qkd123-component-showcase-page`
- `fix/qkd456-demo-interaction-bug`
- `docs/qkd789-api-reference-update`

**Types:**
- `feat` - New features or documentation sections
- `fix` - Bug fixes in demos or documentation
- `docs` - Documentation content updates
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

## Submitting Changes

### Commit Message Format

Follow the conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Structure:**
- **type**: The type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- **scope**: The ticket number (e.g., QKD123)
- **description**: A brief description of the change

**Examples:**
```
feat(QKD123): add button component showcase page

fix(QKD456): resolve interactive demo scroll issue

docs(QKD789): update installation guide with new examples

style(QKD101): format documentation components according to prettier rules

refactor(QKD202): optimize component demo loading performance

test(QKD303): add unit tests for documentation navigation
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Pull latest changes** (ensure you're working with the latest code from the default `main` branch):
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2. **Create and switch to your feature branch**:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/qkd123-your-feature-description
```

3. **Make your changes and commit**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(QKD123): add your feature description"
```

4. **Push to the repository**:

```

5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Navigate to the repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch and target the `main` branch (default branch)
   - Fill out the PR template with the required information
